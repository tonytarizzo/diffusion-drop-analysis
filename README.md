These scripts were used to analyse image sequence data for two drops, diffusing in agar gel.

The red drop refers to sodium hydroxide being dropped onto the agar gel that has an indicator inside.
The blue drop refers to iron chloride being dropped onto agar gel with Prussian Blue, causing a reaction.

The radii of the drops were extracted from the image sequence data using a mask and contouring.
The experimental data was then compared with theoretical equations (which did not end up lining up very much).

For the red drop, there was an unkown diffusion coefficient so I create a least squares method to find the most likely value. This was my first attempt at effectively writing a crude optimiser which was intersting!
